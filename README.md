My name is Alex, I am seventeen years old, I live in Transylvania. 

I have been programming since I was 11. In the beggining it was simple programs in Python, then I started creating games in Roblox in Lua. At 13 years I started writing in Java, but instead of learning frameworks, standards and reading books, 13 year old me preferred to write plugins for Minecraft...

But besides Minecraft, I wrote simple applications in Swing, JavaFX, dealt with LWJGL and even studied the structure of the JVM virtual machine. At 14-15, I wrote a little in C# when I was creating a game in Unity, but the project is closed. I also wrote apps in C++ Winforms.

So it turned out that I know Java completely, it became my favorite language, but I have little experience with libraries and frameworks.

Gamedev has ceased to interest me now and I want to develop programming languages, write libraries and software for them. I really like it. I dream to work in Jetbrains ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¿.
